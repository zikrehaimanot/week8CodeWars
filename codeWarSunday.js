// Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
//
// If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.
//
// Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS, Go, and Java), "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP and Python, Haskell, Lua) or "¥" (Rust).
